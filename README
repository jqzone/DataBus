DataBus is a fast data transmit from endpoint to endpoint.
DataBus provides these functions:
1) data transfer in multi-threads, using access share memory.
2) data transfer in processes, using local socket.
3) data transfer in different nodes, using event-driven message forward.
It builds on zero-mq, which makes data transfer more fluently.
Its structure is a raw Master-Slave, so it will be easy to make compatible with distributed computing framework.
